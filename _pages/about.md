Bio
======
My name is Spencer Gales but I prefer Brady. I am a PhD student at the University of Arizona in the program applied mathematics in the lab of Dr. Ingmar Riedel - Kruse.

Research Interests
======
Mathematical modeling, computational biology, synthetic biology, bioelectrochemical engineering. 

Research 
======
+ **Biofilm Bioelectrochemical Reactor for Reverse Methanogenesis and Diol Synthesis** We propose a novel bioelectrochemical reactor for diol product synthesis utilizing microbial consortia for reverse methanogenesis with a bioanode as a terminal electron acceptor. For the reactor we introduce a model for design and optimization of model parameters.
