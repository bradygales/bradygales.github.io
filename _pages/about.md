Research 
======
+ **Biofilm Bioelectrochemical Reactor for Reverse Methanogensis and Diol Synthesis** We propose a novel bioelectrochemical reactor for diol product synthesis utilizing microbia consortia for reverse methanogeneis with a bioanode as a terminal electron acceptor. For the reactor we introduce a model for design and optimization of model paramaters.
